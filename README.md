# FeedForwardNN_With_NumPy
A FFNN, made only with NumPy, to recognise numbers from the MNIST data set.

# Description
This is a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), where the number of layers can be decided by the user.

This FFNN is just for educational purposes and is ***not*** optimized.
Some important issues with this network are memory management, local minimums and vanishing gradients.

# Dependencies
Python 3.7

The following Python libraries are required:

Numpy
  
Matplotlib
  
Pandas

Optional: Use Anaconda envirment with Spyder IDE

# Setup
Just follow the instructions in Setup_Instructions.txt file in order to obtain the MNIST data set.
