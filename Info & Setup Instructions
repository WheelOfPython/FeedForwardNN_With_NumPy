---FeedForwardNN_With_NumPy---

This is a MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), where the number of layers can be decided by the user.

This FFNN is just for educational purposes and is not optimized.
Some important issues with this network are memory management, local minimums and vanishing gradients.

Recuirments:
	Python 3
	Numpy
	Matplotlib
	Pandas
Optional: Use Anaconda envirment with Spyder IDE

SetUp:

0)Download the Git files and put them inside a new folder, that will be your working directory

1)Go to this website:
	http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
and download these files:
	train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz:  training set images (9912422 bytes) 
	train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz:  training set labels (28881 bytes) 

Extract them into your working directory

Make a folder named x_train and put inside the extracted train-images.idx3-ubyte
Make a folder named y_train and put inside the extracted train-labels.idx3-ubyte

!Make sure the form of the extracted files is .idx3-ubyte and not -idx3-ubyte

2)Install mlxtend with:
pip install mlxtend

3)Run load_mnist.py

4)The created folders now contain csv files of MNIST!
